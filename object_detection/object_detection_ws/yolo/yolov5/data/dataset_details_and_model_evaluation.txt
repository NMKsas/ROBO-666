In this document the details of the dataset used for training the object detection model and the evaluation of that model are presented.

Note that both the training and the evaluation images were taken in a single room (RoboLab, Tampere University). Thus, there is no guarantee
that the model will perform this well in other kinds of environments. If the lightning conditions or appearence of the background are significantly
different in final environment of use compared to RoboLab environment, retraining the model with images taken in the final environment is recommended.

Also note that the training dataset details below present information about data that has already been augmented (using rotation, flipping, and hsv-conversion).
The size of the original dataset before augmentation was probably around 15 % of the size of the augmented dataset (600-800 images). Unfortunately, detailed
information of the non-augmented dataset was lost during the development process due to multiple iterations of adding images to the dataset and augmenting them
separately.
